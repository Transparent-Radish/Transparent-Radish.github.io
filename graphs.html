      <center>I backed up these graphs on a different account than the one synced up to my school email because I'm concerned about what will happen to the graphs when I no longer have access to that email account.

            I was bored in study hall, so I decided to make some<br>
            art for several of my friends. I decided to make a pie<br>
            becuase I thought it would be easy. I then emailed<br>
            the graph along with this message: "<a>Howdy. I'm be <br>
            Hunny McFriedpiecake. I has been makin' sum fixins,<br>
            and I be makin' a math pie! Here is the pie, if <br>

            After making the graph for the pie, I thought to go <br>
            further with the theme, I would also make an ice<br>
            cream cone to go with the pie. I sent another email<br>
            as a reply to the original, where I was still Hunny<br>
            McFriedpiecake with the link to the graph and about<br>
            how we're approaching the hot days of December.

            After learning that I could have lists in Desmos, I<br>
            decided to make a circle out of circles. It's pretty<br>
            simple, but I thought it looked really cool.

            Apparently I really liked circles at this time.<br>
            I don't remember much about this graph, except<br>
            that I shared this with a friend in between matches<br>
            when we were playing Fortnite together. I probably<br>
            named it oof because I suck at naming things.

            I made this around the time when ski club started. <br>
            I thought that since I was already making art, I <br>
            would continue that and make some insects.<br>
            I remember waiting in line to either get my ski pass<br>
            or check into the ski resort while my phone's battery<br>
            was nearing death as I finished up this graph.

            When I was sitting on the bus for ski club, I was<br>
            trying to think about ways to pass time. Then, I had<br>
            the great idea to try and do something beyond art<br>
            with this graphing calculator. I thought it would be<br>
            simple enough to make a customizable rectangular <br>
            prism even though I knew nothing about 3D <br>
            projections. Long story short, I didn't have any clue <br>
            what I was doing and gave up on the project.

            After failing to make a rectangular prism and <br>  
            learning how to shade a sphere in my drawing class,<br>
            I thought that I should draw a sphere with graphs.

            Yes, you read that title correctly. I made an English <br> 
            Project with this graphing calculator. This was about <br>
            The Odyssey, the book that I understood the least out <br>
            of any book I've read, and the source of the worst <br>
            test grade I've ever gotten. I got some key details of <br>
            the book wrong in this assignment, but at least I made <br>
            something that looked cool. We had a few days to <br>
            make it, so I spent practically whole days typing <br>
            out equations.

            One day I woke up, and I saw in a group chat of <br>
            mine, that it was one of my friend's birthdays. <br>
            Of course, I had to get / make her something, so I <br>
            decided to make a graph of a birthday cake for her.
