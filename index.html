        <a>Hi! If you couldn't tell already, my name is Luke.</a>
        
        <br><br>
        
        As I'm writing this, I'm a senior in high school who spends way too much of his freetime playing
        videogames. What you're seeing here is some of the cool stuff I've done when I haven't been 
        wasting countless hours of my life clicking away at the computer.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <a>
            So far, I've taught myself some math to skip ahead of certain classes, wrote programs in various
            languages (Java, Python, JS, and some C), made a few crappy games and simulations (a lot of 
            incomplete/abandoned ones lol), and made some cool art / models with a graphing calculator called
            Desmos. I've also made some physical art while in classes and clubs.
        </a>
        
        <br><br>
        
        This is just a place where I will showcase all of those things that I'm most proud of making.
